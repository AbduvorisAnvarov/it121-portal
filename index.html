       <p>My name is Abduvoris Anvarov and I am a 20-year-old Year up student that is pursuing the software development and testing track. Along with attending school, I am also a part time employee as an emergency roadside dispatcher with over 4 years of experience in customer service career field. I am a very passionate software developer that loves programming and I am constantly growing my knowledge on hard skills and soft skills and my ability to handle difficulty situation and multi-task is very strong and is constantly improving as I gain more work experience. </p>
             
       <p>I am proud of myself to be a hard working person because that has helped me in life to get through situations where I did not want to be in, and it is a component that constantly helps me to vision what the outcome will be like if I were to work as hard as I can to accomplish something. Therefore i am pursuing software developer & testing track in order to gain the opportunity to get a job at a tech company as a software programmer/tester. </p>
                  
      <p>I am a full time student as well as a full time employee, and on my days off, I like to play sports such as basketball, soccer nad football for fun. Another fun fact about me is that I write songs, record and produce them!</p>
